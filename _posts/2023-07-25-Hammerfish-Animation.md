This is a part of some early testing I've been doing for creature animations, meant for a small game that's been knocking around in my head. The idea is to have several animals roaming about the environment. I'm just one person so I felt like my best shot at accomplishing that would be to do all the modeling inside Houdini, rely on CHOPs-driven animation, and a bit of simulation sprinkled throughout to quickly give life to each of the creatures. After modeling and animating, I export them using the VAT output SideFX ships, allowing for much more fauna than what would be possible with bone-based animations. In my mind, the modeling/animation has to be procedural so that I can create the animations as I model each piece and add more detail to the animals without having to reanimate pieces I've created before. This serves as a brief walkthrough of the setup for this "Hammerfish". At the bottom of the page, you'll find an image of the full network.
