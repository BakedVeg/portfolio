This is a part of some early testing I've been doing for creature animations, meant for a small game that's been knocking around in my head. The idea is to have several animals roaming about the environment. I'm just one person so I felt like my best shot at accomplishing that would be to do all the modeling inside Houdini, rely on CHOPs-driven animation, and a bit of simulation sprinkled throughout to quickly give life to each of the creatures. After modeling and animating, I export them using the VAT output SideFX ships, allowing for much more fauna than what would be possible with bone-based animations. In my mind, the modeling/animation has to be procedural so that I can create the animations as I model each piece and add more detail to the animals without having to reanimate pieces I've created before. This serves as a brief walkthrough of the setup for this "Hammerfish". At the bottom of the page, you'll find an image of the full network.

    <h2>Main Body</h2>
    <p>I started with a sphere, grouped both ends and used soft transforms to get the desired bell shape. Then smoothed the result.</p>

    <h2>"Hammers"</h2>
    <p>I find it easier to start with curves when there's a specific silhouette I'm looking for. This is extruded and then subdivided. The top and bottom faces are grouped and transformed to give a rounder appearance after its been converted to a VDB, back to polygons, and smoothed. The result is mirrored to give that hammerhead-like shape. Little details are added to it afterward. </p>
